# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model-Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn for Beta Bank by building machine learning models to predict which customers are likely to leave the bank, helping the bank retain existing customers rather than acquiring new ones. I preprocess the data, handle class imbalance using various techniques, train and tune different models.
